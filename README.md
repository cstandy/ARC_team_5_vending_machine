# ARC team 5 vending machine


## Introduction
We use ARC as our user terminal and connect to the server, which is implemented with cloud data management and smart selling system. Peripheral devices and sensors are added to the ARC exp. WiFi, temperature sensor, OLED and many more.

Our vending machine system provides maintainance issue related to vending machine, such as auto-checking for food expired date, temperature overheat detecting. Other than that, vending machine is connected to database which users are allow to use their id for payment without physical bills or coins, and the machine will recommend what to buy depending on the purchase records of that user. The reason why our machine is different from others, the system administrator can get the information by signing in far away from the vending machine; the costomer can pay cashlessly. With e-payment, according to the purchase record of customer or other information, our machine can easily give some recommand after some operation, which can effectively decrease the time for customer making decision and interact with interest.
