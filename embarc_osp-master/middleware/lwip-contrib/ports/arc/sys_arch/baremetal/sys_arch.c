 *
 *  - Fixed an unlikely sys_thread_new() race condition.
 *
 *  - Made current_thread() work with threads which where
 *    not created with sys_thread_new().  This includes
 *    the main thread and threads made with pthread_create().
 *
 *  - Catch overflows where more than SYS_MBOX_SIZE messages
 *    are waiting to be read.  The sys_mbox_post() routine
 *    will block until there is more room instead of just
 *    leaking messages.
