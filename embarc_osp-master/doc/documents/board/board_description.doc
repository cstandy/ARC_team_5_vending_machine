\section sect_board_introduction Introduction

The <b>Board Support Package (BSP) Layer</b> provides support for different boards based on ARCv2 processors.
The layer contains the following functions:	\n

- <b>Peripherals driver instantiation</b>	\n
  In embARC, an object-oriented design is applied for device drivers. The peripheral driver implementations are similar to the definition of class in the device abstraction layer. So the peripheral drivers should be instantiated for every board.
  For example, dw_gpio_obj.c / dw_gpio_obj.h is the instantiation of the DesignWare GPIO driver implementation in device abstraction layer, which contains the information of register address, interrupt number, etc.

- <b>Common board initialization process</b>	\n
  A standard bootup process is defined for each board. The entry of this process is <b>board_main</b> defined in <b>board/board.c</b>, it will cover board initialization, os environment setup, fatfs and ntshell initialization, finally it will enter to *main* function if required.

- <b>Board resource unified definition</b>	\n
  Most boards share common peripherals. Unified definitions are provided such as UART used to print messages, SD card interface, buttons, LEDs.

- <b>Linker script for boards</b>	\n
  Linker script now is auto-generated from template using the ICCM/DCCM and DDR memory information. We provided template for both gnu and metaware tool, located in <b>board</b> folder, called *linker_template_gnu.ld* and *linker_template_mw.ld*.

\section sect_board_common_board_init_process Common Board Initialization Process
  The common *board_main* function should do the following operations:
  - Board initialization steps - defined in *board_init* function.
    - Install required device driver objects, such as UART/SPI/IIC device objects.
    - Clear and disable all interrupts.
    - Initialize 1 ms timer interrupt.
    - Initialize some peripherals if used.
    - Initialize other required board resources such as mux controller.
  - xprintf library setup to provide printf functionality
  - Initialization of fatfs if FatFs middleware is selected
  - Initialization of FreeRTOS tasks if defined
  - Go to *main* function

\section sect_board_add_new_board_to_embARC Adding New Board to embARC

Follow the steps below to add a new board:
- Modify board.mk and board.h. Please refer the EMSK related definitions. Copy EMSK definitions and modify them for your board. EMSK serves as a good template for adding a new board.
- Create a sub directory under <b>board</b> and name it as <target_board>. Add <target_board>.mk and <target_board>.h. The basic information should be added in <target_board>.mk, such as source directories, including directories, object output directories and make rules.
- Add the source files. The build system will automatically compile all the source files (.c, .s) in the directories described in <target_board>.mk and create library named lib<target_board>.a.
- Take other board support folder like <b><embARC>/board/emsk</b> for reference.
