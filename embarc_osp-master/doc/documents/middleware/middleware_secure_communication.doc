\section sect_middleware_secure_communication_mbedtls mbed TLS
    [mbed TLS](https://tls.mbed.org/) (formerly known as PolarSSL) makes it trivially easy for developers to include cryptographic and SSL/TLS capabilities in their (embedded) products, facilitating this functionality with a minimal coding footprint.

    mbed TLS is available as open source under the Apache 2.0 license, the GPL 2.0 license, or under an mbed partnership. The Apache 2.0 license enables you to use mbed TLS in both open source and closed source projects.

    embARC supports mbed TLS in FreeRTOS.

\section sect_mid_add_tls_dtls_support_in_embarc Adding TLS/DTLS Support in embARC

Due to export control requirements for United States companies, mbed TLS is not distributed as part of embARC. These packages have been ported and verified for use with embARC. The embARC OSP distribution contains required patches to integrate mbed TLS into embARC.

Refer to \ref EMBARC_APPLY_PATCHES "Download and apply patches" for detailed information.
