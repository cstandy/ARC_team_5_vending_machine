\section sect_middleware_general_middleware_common Common
    Common middleware consists of [ringbuffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) and xprintf() packages; xprintf() is a lightweight printf() library used in embedded systems without support for floating point. For more information about xprintf(), see [its website](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/strf/xprintf.html).

\section sect_middleware_general_middleware_ntshell NT-Shell
    Natural Tiny Shell ([NT-Shell](http://cubeatsystems.com/ntshell/)) is a tiny shell software component for small embedded systems.

    NT-Shell is licensed under an MIT license.

\section sect_middleware_general_middleware_fatfs FatFs
    [FatFs](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html) is a generic FAT file-system module for small embedded systems. The FatFs module is written in compliance with ANSI C (C89) and completely separated from the disk I/O layer. It is therefore platform-independent.

    FatFs is licensed under a permissive BSD-style license.

\section sect_middleware_general_middleware_u8glib U8glib
    [U8glib](https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib) is a monochrome graphics library for LCDs and OLEDs. It supports many different monochrome displays, a large number of fonts, and well-defined C/C++ APIs.

    U8glib code is licensed under the terms of [the new BSD license (two-clause BSD license)](https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib/blob/master/license.txt).

\section sect_middleware_general_middleware_fymodem fymodem
    [YModem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMODEM) is a file transfer protocol used between microcomputers connected together using modems.

    [fymodem](https://github.com/fredrikhederstierna/fymodem) is a free YModem implementation.

\section sect_middleware_general_middleware_ihex iHex
    [Intel HEX(IHEX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX) is a file format that conveys binary information in ASCII text form. It is commonly used for programming microcontrollers, EPROMs, and other types of programmable logic devices. In a typical application, a compiler or assembler converts a program's source code (such as in C or assembly language) to machine code and outputs it into a HEX file. The HEX file is then imported by a programmer to "burn" the machine code into a ROM, or is transferred to the target system for loading and execution.

    [ihex](https://github.com/arkku/ihex) is a free Intel HEX format parser implementation.
