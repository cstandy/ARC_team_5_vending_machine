\section sect_middleware_network_stack_lwip lwIP
    [lwIP](http://lwip.nongnu.org/) is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite, initially developed by Adam Dunkels.

    The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce resource usage while still providing full-scale TCP. This makes lwIP suitable for use in embedded systems with as little as 10s of KBs of free RAM and 40 KB of code ROM.
    Main features include:
    - Protocols: IP, ICMP, UDP, TCP, IGMP, ARP, PPPoS, PPPoE.
    - DHCP client, DNS client, AutoIP/APIPA (Zeroconf), SNMP agent (private MIB support).
    - APIs: specialized APIs for enhanced performance, optional Berkeley-like socket API.
    - Extended features: IP forwarding over multiple network interfaces, TCP congestion control, RTT estimation, and fast recovery/fast retransmit.
    - Add-on applications: HTTP server, SNTP client, SMTP client, ping, NetBIOS nameserver.

\section sect_middleware_network_stack_openthread OpenThread
    uIP stack integrated into Contiki, supports IPv4, IPv6, RPL, 6LowPAN.

    OpenThread is an open-source implementation of the Thread networking protocol. Nest has released OpenThread to make the technology used in Nest products more broadly available to developers to accelerate the development of products for the connected home.

    The Thread specification defines an IPv6-based reliable, secure and low-power wireless device-to-device communication protocol for home applications. More information about Thread can be found on threadgroup.org.
    - Highly portable: OS and platform agnostic with a radio abstraction layer
    - Implements the End Device, Router, Leader and Border Router roles
    - Small memory footprint

    OpenThread implements all Thread networking layers including IPv6, 6LoWPAN, IEEE 802.15.4 with MAC security, Mesh Link Establishment, and Mesh Routing.
