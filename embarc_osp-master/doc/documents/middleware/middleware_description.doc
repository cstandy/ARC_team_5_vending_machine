\section sect_mid_middleware_intro Middleware Introduction

embARC leverages several open-source projects to deliver integrated IoT protocol stack choices for embedded devices based on ARC processors. This section describes various middleware packages that have been ported and integrated for use in embARC.

# Notes on Middleware Table
- All available middleware packages are located in <em><embARC>/middleware</em>. You can access them by their folder name, such as ntshell or fatfs.
- <b>√</b> means this middleware is supported in this environment, and **x** means not supported.
- Add the value in the **MID_SEL** column to the **MID_SEL** option in the application makefile.
- **aws** middleware required *mbedtls* middleware.
- **coap, mqtt, and lwm2m** are only for FreeRTOS. and require *lwip and lwip-contrib*.
- **mbedtls** require *fatfs* middleware to provide file access in some cases.
- **lwip** middleware is only for FreeRTOS.
- **openthread** middleware requires **mbedtls** to support encryption.

\section sect_mid_add_new_middleware_to_embARC Adding New Middleware to embARC
Follow the steps below to add new middleware:
- Create a sub-folder named <target-middleware> in middleware.
- Create <target-middleware>.mk in the folder <target-middlware>. Note that the .mk file name must be the same as the folder's so that the build system can find the new makefile.
- Add necessary definitions in <target-middleware>.mk, such as folders (MID_INCDIR, MID_CSRDIR, MID_ASM_DIR), source files (MID_XXX_CSRCS, MID_XXX_ASMSRCS), and MID_DEFINES.
- Use the other middleware makefiles for reference.
