 * \brief	embARC Example for LwM2M Client on LwIP and FreeRTOS
 *
 * \details
 * ### Extra Required Tools
 *
 * ### Extra Required Peripherals
 *     * Digilent PMOD WIFI(MRF24WG0MA)
 *
 * ### Design Concept
 *     This example is designed to show how to use LwM2M client in FreeRTOS.
 *
 * ### Usage Manual
 *     The Pmod modules should be connected to \ref EMBARC_BOARD_CONNECTION "EMSK".
 *     This is an example running OMA LightweightM2M(LwM2M) client, provides core device management features(device, connectivity, etc). It provides a ntshell command called *lwm2m_client* to show this demo.
 *     - About LwM2M provided in embARC
 *         + LwM2M features supported by [eclipse wakaama project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.wakaama)
 *         + We only support FreeRTOS+LwIP
 *         + LwM2M use UDP connections to exchange data
 *     - First, you need to provide a LwM2M Server, here we take [Eclipse Leshan server](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan) for example.
 *         + Eclipse provide a sandbox leshan server:http://leshan.eclipse.org/
 *         + You can download a standalone leshan server binary from leshan website, and java environment(version >= 1.7.0_75) is required to run this binary
 *     - When leshan server is running on your local PC(connected to the same wifi network which your board will connect), then download program to the board, and run *lwm2m_client* ntshell command.
 *         + If you local PC IP is 192.168.43.4, then you need to run command *lwm2m_client -s 192.168.43.4* to connect to local leshan server.
 *         + If connected to local leshan server, you will see the connected LwM2M client in http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/clients.
 *         + Click on the client, then you will see many objects which the connected client provided.
 *         + On this website, you can do many operations on this objects.
 *         + Here you can read onboard switch and button value, and control onboard led using Object 1024.
 *             * First read the Instance 0, then 4 resources will show. Resource 0 is button value, Resource 1 is switch value, Resource 2 is led control, Resource 3 is a float variable.
 *             * Read Instance 0/1 will return the value of this resources in DEC format, you can press buttons or pull on/up the switches to see value changes.
 *             * Write on Resource 2 in DEC format such as 34 will change the onboard led with value 34.
 *             * Write on Resource 3 with a float value such as 1.45, then the float value is changed, you can read back to check it.
 *

 *
 * ### Extra Comments
 *     - Sometimes the server may not respond to client, this may caused by the wifi connection is bad.
 *     - In the case above, you need to disconnect all the power of your board, reconnect PMOD WIFI module and wait for a while, then restart this application.
